## Activation Functions

Activation functions play a key role in every neural network. They decide which nodes to fire in a particular layer. These functions are applied to hidden as well as to the output layers of a neural network.

Activation functions take the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias as input to the function (w(i)*x(i)+b) and perform the necessary computation to decide which nodes to fire in a layer.

There are 5 popular activation functions that play a significant role in building a neural network. Choosing the right activation function depends on the kind of task you are performing.

Following are some examples of Activation functions:
