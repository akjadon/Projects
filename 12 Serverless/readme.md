## Edge Computing

Edge computing is a method of optimizing cloud computing systems by performing data processing at the edge of the network near the source of the data.

The cloud refers to computing powered by large, distributed groups of servers, whereas the edge refers to compute on the edge of the network, closer to or at the data source itself. 

While edge computing exclusively refers to compute at the ingress of the network, fog computing is inclusive of computing anywhere along the continuum, from cloud to the edge.
