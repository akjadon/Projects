## Edge Computing

While the cloud refers to computing powered by large, distributed groups of servers, the edge refers to compute on the edge of the network, closer to or at the data source itself. And, while edge computing exclusively refers to compute at the ingress of the network, fog computing is inclusive of computing anywhere along the continuum, from cloud to the edge.
